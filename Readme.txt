current player is listed at the top and their pits are highlighted

pits are ordered in a circular pattern with p1 on top and p2 on the bottom in a counterclockwise fashion

To see the score class, the following series of inputs is the fastest way to end a default game of Mankala that we've found:
0 0 2 4 1 5 0 2 3

for testing extensibility, amount of pits can be edited in Game.cs
large quantities of pits may require ultrawide monitors to view properly

changes from design documents will be explained in comments the list of altered classes:
